                                <span>● As the price of Digital Assets is very volatile and subject to fluctuation, you acknowledge that the actual market rate at which order and/or transaction is executed may vary.</span>

                                <br />

                                <br />

                                <span>● It is illegal in India and all relevant jurisdictions (save where the proper licenses are obtained) to require a person to pay money, give something of value, or expend significant effort (in legal terms, "consideration") to enter or participate in an activity or promotion in which he or she may win a prize
                                    if there is a significant degree of chance involved (e.g., a random drawing to determine winners) ("Illegal Gambling"). Accordingly, we have an internal gambling policy that prohibits the use of TradeKIA for storing, sending, or receiving wagers or its illegal proceeding. It is derived from trading contracts for
                                    differences and spread bets on licensed and regulated platforms that do not constitute Illegal Gambling or a
                                    violation of its policy. We employ a number of methods to detect violations of our gambling Policy.
                                    You agree and understand that we have the right to immediately (i) suspend your User Account and any
                                    related User Account, (ii) freeze/lock the funds and Digital Assets in all such User Accounts, and (iii)
                                    suspend your access to TradeKIA, if we suspect, in our sole discretion, any such User Account to be in
                                    violation of this policy, which is a direct violation of these Terms. We have the right to terminate any
                                    such User Accounts and take any and all necessary and appropriate actions pursuant to these Terms and/or
                                    Applicable Laws.</span>

                                <span>10.1. A considerable loss may be sustained/incurred while trading in Digital Assets, hence you
                                    are advised to determine your financial circumstances and risk tolerance before trading and carefully
                                    consider the following risks:</span>


                                <br />

                                <br />

                                <span>10.1.1 Digital Assets are currently unregulated and trading, holding, and transferring some or all Digital
                                    Assets may be deemed illegal in India in the future. You are encouraged to obtain appropriate legal counsel
                                    regarding the same before using our services.</span>

                                <br />

                                <br />

                                <span>10.1.2 The value of any Digital Asset is very volatile and you may sustain a total loss of your Funds; Due to the market being
                                    in a nascent stage, during a market disruption or during a force majeure event, you may face difficulties or impossibility in
                                    liquidating your position under certain market conditions.</span>

                                <br />

                                <br />

                                <span>10.1.3 Digital Assets are not backed by a central bank or any other financial regulator and as such, there is no third party that may
                                    take any corrective action upon the occurrence of a global/regional crisis;</span>

                                <br />

                                <br />

                                <span>10.1.4 Since Digital Assets are held online, they are susceptible to security breaches and government crackdowns that may end up compromising
                                    the integrity or anonymity of the system that produces such Digital Assets;</span>

                                <br />

                                <br />

                                <span>10.2. You acknowledge that the aforementioned is a non-exhaustive statement of risks associated with the trade of Digital Assets and that there may be additional risks
                                    not listed or foreseen by the Company.</span>

                                <br />

                                <br />

                                <span>10.3. By creating a User Account, you acknowledge that you have carefully assessed your financial standing and risk tolerance and you confirm that
                                    the same is suitable for trading in Digital Assets.</span>
